## Instal

Cannot be installed on Termux!Proot-Distro environment is possible
<details> I made it with Termux and Debian, but it doesn't work with Termux.  
(When I tried the installation in Termux, it was installed half way and I wandered around the apt or dpkg command to recover its state.  
If possible, I'd like to explore how to make it a termux pkg as a future task.</details>

Ways 1 using pip (from this repository) 

Package and install directly from this repository with pip
```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/Suletta-Majo/uhelp.git
```  
This works in Python


Ways 2 using .deb  
*choose Debian deb package your CPU architecture*  

~~[x64](https://)~~ &nbsp;/&nbsp;[arm64](https://) 

```sh
apt install ./uhelp-1.0.deb
```
This is the deb package that is compiled with the OneFile option by [nuitka](https://github.com/Nuitka/Nuitka)



### git clone (for debug, for Contribute)  
Be sure to change the pathstyle = "xxx" at the beginning of
 uhelp.py to "python".
for Developers, contributors, and anyone wanting to tweak the build  

Create a directory for that purpose, go into it, and then  

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Suletta-Majo/uhelp.git
```  

In that directory you can run like  

```sh
python3 ./uhelp.py ls
```  
...to test program


&nbsp;
## Usage

If you install with pip, you can call it with `uh`,  
and if you install deb with apt, you can call it with `uh` or `uhelp`.

show your command reference below example `ls`

```sh
uh ls
```  
```sh
uhelp ls
```
